       "2256  URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/23.html#now_heavily_medicated Date: 2002-09-23T16:11:02-05:00 Trust me when I tell you that heavy medication and RDF do not mix. Here is a list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in index.html[2]. - _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. - _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF [5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. - _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to yesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? Today's newzzz... Never mind. - Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a FOAF file from an RSS feed. - _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. - mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. - _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. - _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both users.&#8221; - New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. - Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... and plunks it into the oil.&#8221; [1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002324.php [2] http://philringnalda.com/archives/0...  \n",

As a first step we will \"*clean*\" and \"*standardize*\" raw text. Our aim is to keep as many \"*informative*\" words as possible, while discarding the \"*uniformative*\" ones. Removing the noise from our texts will help to improve the accuracy of our models.\n",
